# 📈 Event-Driven Trading System

A event-driven trading system designed to demonstrate how modern trading platforms are built using **event streaming, microservices, and real-time communication**.

This project focuses on **decoupled services**, **asynchronous processing**, and **real-time updates**, similar to architectures used in real-world institutional trading systems.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The system processes inquiry events (inquiries and positions) using an **event-driven architecture**.  
Services communicate via **Kafka based event bus**, and updates are pushed to a **real-time UI using WebSockets**.

This project is intended for:
- Demonstrating event-driven system design
- Demonstrating trading-system architecture
---

## 🧩 Key Features

- ✅ Kafka-based event bus
- ✅ Redis based position management
- ✅ Protobuf-based message serialization
- ✅ WebSocket-based real-time UI updates
- ✅ Modular services (easy to extend)
